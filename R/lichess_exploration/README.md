# Exploring Lichess Dataset

## Overview
In this case study I will anaylyse stop and searchd data collected from https://data.police.uk/. I specifically analyse stop and search data from Merseyside in December 2021. The analysis includes preparing and exploring the data and cleaning the data. After the data was cleaned, I analyzed the data and made visuals to illustrate the findings of the analysis.

## Future Releases
- One thing I would like to do is expand the analysis to include more months and more areas
- I would also like to build a model that can predict the number of stop and searches expected in future months
