# International Football SQL Exploration

## Overview
In this case study I analyze an Internation football dataset collected from https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017. This dataset includes 43,170 games international football matches between the years of 1872 to 2021. In this exploration I specifically use SQL queries to explore the dataset; this is accomplished using sqldf which is from pandasql.

## Future Releases
- I would like to include nested queries in the next release to demonstrate a higher ability using SQL
- I would like to add matplotlib visuals for some for some of the queries we have wrote in the next release
